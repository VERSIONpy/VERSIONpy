# Hey, I'm VERSION 👋

CSE (AI/ML) student who’s currently focused on getting **MERN**, building small but complete projects, and slowly moving towards **ML and open-source**.

I’m not chasing buzzwords — just trying to build, break, and learn properly.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Up To
- Grinding **MERN basics**
- Exploring **open-source** and preparing myself for stuff like GSoC
- Trying to be more consistent than perfect

---

## 🛠️ Tech I Use
**Languages**
- Python  
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- MySQL
- REACT
- Git & GitHub  
- VS Code  

**Currently learning**
- Machine Learning (slow but steady)
- MERN STACK

🤔 I’m looking for help with contributing to open source and understanding how real-world projects are structured.


---



## 🎯 Goals (for real)
- Start contributing to **open-source**
- Land meaningful **internships**
- Be properly industry-ready by the end of my BTech
  
---

** 😄 Fun Facts**
- I’ve tried many games, but finishing things is my new endgame.
- I like keeping things simple — in code and life.
- Still learning, still confused, still moving forward.
